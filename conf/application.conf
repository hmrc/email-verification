# Session Timeout
# ~~~~
# The default session timeout for the app is 15 minutes (900seconds).
# Updating this is the responsibility of the app - it must issue a new cookie with each request or the session will
# timeout 15 minutes after login (regardless of user activity).

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!
